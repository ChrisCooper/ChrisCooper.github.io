I did a lot of 3D modelling and animation growing up, with Maya's Personal Learning Edition. It was a TON of fun, though looking back I'm sure my methods were quite primitive. I came out of it with some fun skills though, and [even a show reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eBPNgupFGo). (Yep, it comes complete with a "Clubbed To Death" soundtrack from The Matrix. Thanks, teenager Chris. ;) )

I'm now getting into learning Unreal Engine 4 (an absolutely wonderful tool so far), so I decided to download the Maya LT trial and dust off my 3D skills in building some game assets. The first thing I remembered upon doing this was that I have no idea how to use the texturing tools! I'd always just used shaders, which require less fiddling, but also give less control. The whole UV mapping thing made sense to me, but I never understood how to use the actual texturing dialogue with all its fancy buttons.

I watched a really simple [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJdPD3cNxz8), and with a little focus, got the idea quickly. Basic texturing is not hard! Anyway, I thought I'd document here my first ever home-made textured model just for fun. I hope to improve from this, since it's um... a starting point, we'll say. :) But here it is!

I must say that this has me excited to build more complex and finished models, and try things like displacement mapping. I'll have to learn some more standard techniques to make my life easier, but I can work with this!
